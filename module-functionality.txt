I'm using laravel 11, with nwidart/laravel-modules package for api module building

Delivery module for handle delivery functionality, Invoice module for invoice management, Payment module for payment solution,
Order module only concern for robust order solution


There can be multiple type of order item like e-commerce product, travel tour, e-learning coarse etc.
Okey let's discuss about order, how many things can be in a order module
order, order items, order return, order refund etc. for complete e-commerce solution

User may want to return an order, that would be refund by payment module, physical order return should be tracked, after
return and verification of that successful it will return, all type of robust functionality that exist need to be implement
